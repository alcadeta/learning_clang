# Learning C

## Plan
- [ ] Set up nvim for C development.
- [ ] Make sure the nvim is set up properly.
- [ ] Dive right on in!

### Discoveries
Use `clang` to create executables from C scripts.
```
clang program.c -o program
```

The C script must have a main function I think. For example:
```
int main() {
    // do stuff...
    return 0;
}
```

It's very (VERY) similar to C# in many many ways. For loops, conditions, and even some of more modern language features such as inline `if` statements etc.

One thing it doesn't have is object-orientation. But that's a ::blessing::.
